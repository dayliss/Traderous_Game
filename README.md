Traderous
==============

A competitive action game emphasising trade and resource management.

Gameplay
==============

Each player begins in one corner of the map and is tasked to collect resources. Each corner is rich in one of four resources, but lacks the other three.Players must buy and sell resources from other players and craft the gear they need to survive the attacks of monsters and other players.

Combat and resource gathering is done in a Link to the Past style overworld while buying, selling, and crafting is done from a UI at the bottom of the screen. 

Players must build one totem at every other player's starting zones. Once one player builds a totem at every other player's starting places, the game is over. Players are ranked and scored based on their total gold at the end of the round, other players they have killed, and the number of totems they managed to place before the round ended. The player with the highest score wins!

My name is Henry Smith. I am one high school student interested in real game development. I don't expect to profit at all from this game, but hope to learn a lot about Git and Java game development. I have been programming for 4 years now and hope to find a career in computer science one day.
